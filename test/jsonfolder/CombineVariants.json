    "description": "\n\n <p>CombineVariants reads in variants records from separate ROD (Reference-Ordered Data) sources and combines them into\n a single VCF. Any number of sources can be input. This tool aims to fulfill two main possible use cases, reflected\n by the two combination options (MERGE and UNION), for merging records at the variant level (the first 8 fields of\n the VCF) or at the genotype level (the rest).</p>\n\n <ul>\n <li><b>MERGE:</b> combines multiple variant records present at the same site in the different input sources into a\n single variant record in the output. If sample names overlap, then they are \"uniquified\" by default, which means a\n suffix is appended to make them unique. <em>Note that in version 3.3, the automatic uniquifying was disabled\n (unintentionally), and required setting `-genotypeMergeOptions UNIQUIFY` manually.</em></li>\n\n <li><b>UNION:</b> assumes that each ROD source represents the same set of samples (although this is not enforced).\n It uses the priority list (if provided) to emit a single record instance at every position represented in the input RODs.</li>\n </ul>\n\n <p>By default, the input sets will be named variants, variants2, variants3, and so on. You can override this by\n providing an explicit name tag for each input, using the syntax \" -V:format,name\". Each input tagged in this\n way will be labeled as such in the output (i.e., set=name rather than set=variants2). For example, you could specify\n a set of control samples as \" -V:vcf,control my_control_samples.vcf\", and the resulting VCF records would contain\n the annotation \"set=control\" in the INFO field. It is strongly recommended to provide explicit names in this way\n when a rod priority list is provided.</p>\n\n <p>CombineVariants will emit a record for every site that was present in any of your input VCF files, and will annotate\n (in the set attribute in the INFO field) whether the record had a PASS or FILTER status in each input ROD . In effect,\n CombineVariants always produces a union of the input VCFs.  However, any part of the Venn of the merged VCFs\n can be extracted using JEXL expressions on the set attribute using SelectVariants.  If you want to extract just\n the records in common between two VCFs, you would first run CombineVariants on the two files to generate a single\n VCF and then run SelectVariants to extract the common records with `-select 'set == \"Intersection\"'`, as worked out\n in the detailed example in the documentation guide.</p>\n\n <h3>Input</h3>\n <p>\n Two or more variant sets to combine.\n </p>\n\n <h3>Output</h3>\n <p>\n A combined VCF.\n </p>\n\n <h3>Usage examples</h3>\n &nbsp;\n <h4>Merge two separate callsets</h4>\n <pre>\n java -jar GenomeAnalysisTK.jar \\\n   -T CombineVariants \\\n   -R reference.fasta \\\n   --variant input1.vcf \\\n   --variant input2.vcf \\\n   -o output.vcf \\\n   -genotypeMergeOptions UNIQUIFY\n </pre>\n\n <h4>Get the union of calls made on the same samples </h4>\n <pre>\n java -jar GenomeAnalysisTK.jar \\\n   -T CombineVariants \\\n   -R reference.fasta \\\n   --variant:foo input1.vcf \\\n   --variant:bar input2.vcf \\\n   -o output.vcf \\\n   -genotypeMergeOptions PRIORITIZE \\\n   -priority foo,bar\n </pre>\n\n <h3>Caveats</h3>\n <ul>\n <li>This tool is not intended to manipulate GVCFS! To combine GVCF files output by HaplotypeCaller, use CombineGVCFs.</li>\n <li>To join intermediate VCFs produced by running jobs in parallel by interval (e.g. by chromosome), use CatVariants.</li>\n </ul>\n\n <h3>Additional notes</h3>\n <ul>\n <li> Using this tool's multi-threaded parallelism capability is particularly useful\n when converting from VCF to BCF2, which can be time-consuming. In this case each thread spends CPU time\n doing the conversion, and the GATK engine is smart enough to merge the partial BCF2 blocks together\n efficiently.  However, since this merge runs in only one thread, you can quickly reach diminishing\n returns with the number of parallel threads.  In our hands, `-nt 4` works well but `-nt 8` tends to be be too much.</li>\n <li>Since GATK 2.1, when merging multiple VCF records at a site, the combined VCF record has the QUAL of the first\n VCF record with a non-MISSING QUAL value.  The previous behavior was to take the max QUAL, which could result\n in strange downstream confusion</li>\n </ul>",
